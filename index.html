					<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
				</div>
				
				<div class="mainContents">
					<p>I have been into gaming and various tech since I was about 8 and my dad bought a Nintendo home.
					At various points of my childhood, I would disassemble various items, (Radios and pcs etc) and learn how they work before reassembling them.</p>
					<p>I left school after year 10 because I was bored. I took up cabinetmaking and moved towards some hands on work.
					I started learning some LUA through and forum and started making some basic add-ons for a game.</p>
					<p>
					My grandma was an artist, I did not consider myself one until I started my hand at software development.
					This was my form of art.
					I am looking to advance my knowledge and skills in this area.

						<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
						<p>The Defender personality type is quite unique, as many of their qualities defy the definition of their individual traits. Though sensitive, Defenders have excellent analytical abilities;
						though reserved, they have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships; and though they are generally a conservative type, Defenders are often receptive to change and new ideas. </p>
						<p>As with so many things, people with the Defender personality type are more than the sum of their parts, and it is the way they use these strengths that defines who they are.</p>

					<h1>My Project</h1>
					<p>I don't currently have a specific idea for my project, however my concept is to design and build an interactive learning toy/tool for my daughter to educate her in her education that is engaging and motivational.
While there are several apps for this already, this would not necessarily be an app, but a device that would encourage and reward the user to keep trying and better themselves through usage.</p>
<p>A simple concept would be a toy robot puppy that would talk to the child and encourage speech interaction and reward the child with play time.
An advanced idea would be a small tablet device which would be expandable in functions and educational levels that would promote learning through rewarding time allocated for free usage of the device such as child friendly media or games.</p>

					<div class="mainHeaders">
						<h3>Minimum Viable Product</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="mainContents">
					<p>The device would require some early learning features for children under 5 to help them develop speech and math skills.
					It would then need to be developed for older children and include other subjects and increase the number of games and educational tools supported.</p>

						<h3>Requirements</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="mainContents">
					<p>The device would require onboard memory with a possible memory expansion for the growing memory requirements.
					An update method would be required, this could be wifi/cloud based download or plug and play into a pc for updates.</p>
					<p>
					Servers would be minimal as it would only be used for updating the device software.
					The software language would need to be determined later as the best language for such a device is currently unknown.</p>

						<h3>Obstacles</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="mainContents">
					<p>My personal experience will be the main limiting factor with the project.
					I currently have no experience with creating and writing code of this level or designing devices of this standard.</p>
					<p>
					This will mean I either need funding for development or find others who want to participate in a project of this type, who have experience in the relevant fields to help design and create the project.</p>

					<p>Once the Project has been reveloped it would ideally be marketed for sale and use with schools and other educational programs.</p>
